# Study

The **Study** section provides structured learning pathways
for understanding Vedic texts and principles.

Study is distinct from the Library:
- the Library preserves canonical texts
- Study explains structure, themes, and ideas
- Guidance applies understanding to life situations

Study focuses on **clarity and comprehension**, not prescription.
