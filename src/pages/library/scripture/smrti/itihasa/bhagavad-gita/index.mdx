# Bhagavad Gītā

The **Bhagavad Gītā** is a foundational text of Vedic literature,
presented as a dialogue between Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna on the battlefield
of Kurukṣetra.

This text addresses the nature of duty, action, knowledge, devotion,
and liberation, within the context of lived responsibility.
