## Editorial Policy

The Library section of Vedic Skills preserves Vedic texts in their
canonical form.

The following rules apply to all Library content:

- Original verses are presented without modification.
- Translations must be approved and attributed.
- Commentaries are presented only as illumination, never as replacement.
- No personal interpretation, application, or advice is added.
- Life-context guidance appears only in the Guidance section.

These boundaries ensure that śāstra remains authoritative, clear,
and accessible across generations.
