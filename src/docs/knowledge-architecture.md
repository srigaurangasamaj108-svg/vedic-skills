# Knowledge Architecture

*Vedic Skills*

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **knowledge architecture** of Vedic Skills.

It exists to ensure that:

* the integrity of Vedic knowledge is preserved
* different modes of engagement remain clearly separated
* growth does not lead to confusion or dilution
* future contributors understand *where* things belong and *why*

This is a **foundational document** and should be consulted before:

* adding new content
* introducing new features
* creating pathways, overlays, or mentoring systems

---

## 2. Core Architectural Principle

**Different kinds of knowledge require different kinds of spaces.**

Vedic Skills is therefore organized into **four distinct pillars**, each with a clear role and boundary:

1. **Library** — Canonical preservation
2. **Study** — Structured understanding
3. **Guidance** — Contextual clarity
4. **Community** — Lived expression and service

These pillars are **complementary**, but **never interchangeable**.

---

## 3. The Four Pillars Explained

### 3.1 Library — Canonical Preservation

**Purpose:**
To preserve and present Vedic texts in their **canonical form**.

**Characteristics:**

* hierarchical, not thematic
* authority flows from text, not interpretation
* slow, careful, disciplined

**What the Library contains:**

* original verses (śāstra)
* approved translations
* traditional commentaries (ācārya-based)

**What the Library does NOT contain:**

* personal interpretation
* life advice
* applications
* modern analogies
* guidance language

The Library corresponds to **śravaṇa** — hearing and receiving.

---

### 3.2 Study — Structured Understanding

**Purpose:**
To help learners **understand** texts, concepts, and frameworks.

**Characteristics:**

* explanatory, not prescriptive
* thematic, but grounded in scripture
* structured as courses and lessons

**What Study contains:**

* courses
* conceptual explanations
* thematic frameworks
* references back to Library verses

**What Study does NOT contain:**

* personal advice
* situational counseling
* mentoring
* emotional or psychological guidance

Study corresponds to **manana** — reflection and comprehension.

---

### 3.3 Guidance — Contextual Clarity

**Purpose:**
To help individuals **orient themselves** in specific life situations.

**Characteristics:**

* situational
* carefully bounded
* ethically governed

**What Guidance contains:**

* frameworks (not prescriptions)
* reflective questions
* decision-support structures
* referrals when needed

**What Guidance does NOT contain:**

* verdicts
* commands
* spiritual authority
* replacement for professional help

Guidance corresponds to **anuṣṭhāna** — thoughtful application.

---

### 3.4 Community — Lived Expression & Seva

**Purpose:**
To express Vedic values through **local, practical service**.

**Characteristics:**

* non-authoritative
* service-oriented
* culturally adaptable

**What Community contains:**

* seva domains (vibhāgas)
* events and gatherings
* study circles
* local initiatives

**What Community does NOT contain:**

* doctrinal teaching
* personal guidance
* interpretive authority

Community exists to **support life**, not to regulate belief.

---

## 4. Canonical Scripture Hierarchy

Scriptural content in the Library follows a **traditional hierarchical taxonomy**, not a modern topical one.

### Primary Categories Include:

* Śruti
* Smṛti

  * Itihāsa
  * Dharma-śāstra
  * Artha-śāstra
  * Kāma-śāstra
  * Nīti-śāstra
* Purāṇas
* Vedāṅga
* Upāṅga
* Upaveda
* Darśana
* Āgama
* Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava literature

Texts are nested according to **tradition**, not convenience.

URLs, folders, and navigation reflect this hierarchy directly.

---

## 5. Separation of Concerns (Critical Rule)

Each pillar answers a **different human question**:

| Pillar    | Question                            |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Library   | “What does the text say?”           |
| Study     | “What does it mean?”                |
| Guidance  | “How do I understand my situation?” |
| Community | “How is this lived together?”       |

No page, feature, or component should attempt to answer more than **one** of these questions.

---

## 6. Taxonomy Philosophy

Taxonomy in Vedic Skills exists to:

* preserve clarity
* enable search and discovery
* reflect tradition

It does **not** exist to:

* label people
* reduce identity
* force categorization

Some taxonomies are:

* **fixed** (scriptural hierarchy, āśrama)
* **expandable** (themes, life contexts)
* **contextual** (guidance overlays)

Taxonomy must always remain **secondary to content**, never dominant.

---

## 7. Growth Discipline

All future expansion must follow this order:

1. Preserve text
2. Explain concepts
3. Offer guidance
4. Enable community expression

Skipping steps leads to:

* preaching
* confusion
* misuse of authority

Growth is intentional, not reactive.

---

## 8. Authority & Responsibility

Vedic Skills does not claim personal authority.

Authority flows from:

* śāstra
* tradition
* careful structure

Responsibility lies in:

* clear boundaries
* ethical safeguards
* humility in guidance
* restraint in claims

---

## 9. Final Note

This architecture is designed to:

* outlive individual contributors
* support multiple generations
* remain adaptable without dilution

All contributors are expected to understand and respect these principles.
