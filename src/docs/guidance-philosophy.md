# Guidance Philosophy  
*Vedic Skills*

---

## 1. Purpose of Guidance

Guidance exists to help individuals **gain clarity**, not to tell them
what to do.

It supports reflection, orientation, and understanding in moments
of uncertainty or transition.

Guidance is offered with care, humility, and restraint.

---

## 2. Guidance Is Not Authority

Vedic Skills does not claim personal or institutional authority
over an individual’s life decisions.

Guidance:
- does not issue commands
- does not give verdicts
- does not replace conscience
- does not override personal agency

The role of guidance is **support**, not control.

---

## 3. Difference Between Study and Guidance

**Study** explains principles and concepts in a general form.

**Guidance** responds to specific situations.

Study asks:
> “What does this mean?”

Guidance asks:
> “How do I understand my situation in light of this?”

Guidance must never replace Study,
and Study must never be personalized into Guidance.

## 4. Nature of Guidance Offered

Guidance in Vedic Skills may include:
- reflective questions
- contextual frameworks
- value-based orientation
- exploration of options
- encouragement toward self-understanding

Guidance avoids:
- direct prescriptions
- moral policing
- emotional dependency
- simplistic solutions

---

## 5. Boundaries and Safeguards

Guidance must always observe the following safeguards:

- respect for privacy
- voluntary participation
- no pressure to disclose
- no judgment of personal choices
- no claims of spiritual superiority

Guidance must remain **time-bound and situational**.

---

## 6. Mentors and Facilitators

Mentors and facilitators:
- guide processes, not outcomes
- support reflection, not decision-making
- recognize the limits of their role

They are expected to:
- remain within defined frameworks
- avoid projecting personal beliefs
- refer when appropriate
- pause when clarity is insufficient

Mentorship is a **responsibility**, not a position of power.

---

## 7. Referral and Pause Principles

Guidance must pause or refer when:
- issues exceed scope
- strong emotional distress is present
- medical, psychological, or legal matters arise
- dependency patterns emerge

Referral is not failure.
It is ethical maturity.

---

## 8. Relationship to Life-Stage Framework

Guidance is informed by life-stage awareness but does not reduce
individuals to categories.

Life-stage frameworks:
- inform sensitivity
- do not define identity
- do not determine outcomes

Each individual remains unique.

---

## 9. Relationship to Community

Guidance is separate from Community activity.

Community spaces:
- offer support and belonging
- do not provide personal guidance
- do not host mentoring interactions

This separation protects both participants and facilitators.

---

## 10. Accountability and Review

Guidance frameworks are:
- reviewed periodically
- updated cautiously
- documented transparently

Any expansion of guidance scope must be deliberate
and institutionally approved.

---

## 11. Final Note

Guidance is an act of **care**.

Care requires:
- humility
- restraint
- patience
- awareness of limits

Where certainty ends, guidance must soften.
