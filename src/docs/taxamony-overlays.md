## 4️⃣ COMPLETE TAXONOMY & OVERLAY MASTER LIST

*(Hybrid śāstra-authoritative + life-interface model)*

This is the **single list you were intuitively asking for**.

### A. CORE TAXONOMIES (FIXED)

These never change.

* Scripture hierarchy (śruti, smṛti, etc.)
* Āśrama (brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha, sannyāsa)
* Pillars (Library / Study / Guidance / Community)

---

### B. LIFE-STAGE TAXONOMIES (CONTROLLED)

Used only in **Guidance & Pathways**, never Library.

* childhood
* adolescence
* youth / student
* pre-marriage
* early marriage
* parenthood
* mature householder
* caregiving
* retirement
* elderhood

---

### C. OVERLAYS (EXPANDABLE, BUT GOVERNED)

These are **contextual lenses**, not identities.

#### High-Priority (Phase 1)

* Youth / college transition
* Early marriage adjustment
* Parenthood (early years)
